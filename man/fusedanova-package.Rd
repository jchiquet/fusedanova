\title{Fused-ANOVA package: general presentation}
\description{
OUTDATED!!!  This package is designed to fit accurately the Fused-ANOVA model,
a penalized method to solve the one-way ANOVA problem by
collapsing the coefficients of \eqn{K}{K} conditions.  For a large
class of weights implemented here, our homotopy algorithm is in
\eqn{\mathcal{O}(K\log(K))}{O(klog(K))}.  These weights induce a
balanced tree structure and simplify the interpretation of the
results. The package contains an illustrating phenotypic data set:
given a trait, we reconstruct a balanced tree structure and assess
its agreement with the known phylogeny.

\section{Problem solved}{


The optimization problem solved by fused-ANOVA is
\if{latex}{\deqn{%
\hat{\beta}_{\lambda} = \arg \min_{\beta}
\left\{\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} \left(Y_{ik}-\beta_k \right)^2
+ \lambda \sum_{k,\ell} w_{kl} \left|\beta_k - \beta_\ell \right|\right\}}}
\if{html}{\out{ <center> &beta;<sup>hat</sup>
<sub>&lambda;<sub>1</sub></sub> =
argmin<sub>&beta;</sub> sum<sub>k</sub> sum_i (Y<sub>ik</sub> - &beta<sub>k</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
+ &lambda; sum<sub>k,l</sub> w<sub>k,l</sub>
&#124; &beta;<sub>k</sub> - &beta;<sub>l</sub> &#124;, </center> }}
\if{text}{\deqn{beta.hat(lambda) = argmin_beta sum_k sum_i (Y_ik - beta_k)^2
+ lambda sum_k sum_l w_kl | beta_k - beta_l|,}}

where \eqn{Y_{ik}}{Y_ik} is the intensity of a continuous random
variable for sample \eqn{i}{i} in condition \eqn{k}{k} and
\eqn{\beta_k}{beta_k} is the mean parameter of condition
\eqn{k}{k}. We denote by \eqn{K}{K} the total number of conditions
and \eqn{n_k}{n_k} the number of sample in each condition.
}

\section{Choice of weights and performance of the algorithm}{


For various weights in the fused-penalty (entailing "laplace",
"gaussian", "default", "adaptive" - see the corresponding
documentation), the homotopy algorithm produces a path that
contains no split, which is highly desirable since in this case
\enumerate{%

\item the order of the \eqn{\beta_k}{beta_k} always matches the order of the
empirical mean of each condition;

\item the recovered structure is a tree which simplifies the
interpretation;

\item the total number of iterations is guaranteed to be small and
equal to \eqn{K}{K};

\item we avoid maximum flow problems whose resolution is
computationally demanding.

}

The associated algorithm is in
\eqn{\mathcal{O}(K\log(K))}{O(klog(K))}. In this perspective, we
extend the work of Hocking et al. to a larger class of weights.

For other weights, split can occur along the path of solution. We
adapted the algorithm developed by Hoefling (reference below) to
the fused-ANOVA problem.
}

\section{Technical remarks}{


Most of the numerical work is done in C++, relying on the
\pkg{Rcpp} package. We also use the multi-core capability of the
computer through the \pkg{parallel} package when multiple
variables are to be classified. This feature is not available for
Windows user, though.
